        <p>A dark blue bathroom might not be for everyone, but i love how much drama and color it brought to the room. in my vintage bathroom, i knew i needed something that wasn&#039;t going to make the space feel smaller (like a bold color) yet something that still would keep it feeling open and bright.</p>
